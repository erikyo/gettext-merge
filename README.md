# Gettex Merger

This tool is designed to merge translation files (pot files) for internationalization (i18n) in JavaScript projects. It is particularly useful when working with multiple contributors or maintaining translations across various versions of your project.

## Features

- **Merge Blocks:** The tool merges translation blocks that have matching `msgid` values. It intelligently combines translator comments and references, ensuring that valuable context is retained.

- **Handling Duplicates:** Duplicate translator comments are not added to the merged block. The tool maintains uniqueness in the merged set.

- **Flexible Merging:** Blocks are merged when the `msgid` values match, and either `msgctx` or `msgstr` is empty for one of the blocks. This flexibility allows merging blocks with different context or translations.

```

### Using as a Library


#### Merging Pot Files

```typescript
import { mergePotFile } from 'gettext-merger';

const filePaths = ['file1.pot', 'file2.pot'];
const [headers, mergedSet] = await mergePotFile(filePaths);
```

#### Merging Pot Strings

```typescript
import { mergePotFileContent } from 'gettext-merger';

const fileContents = [
	`msgid "Product Status"
msgstr "Field: Useless Product Status"

#. Chunk file for editing product page
#: assets/client/admin/chunks/edit-product-page.js:1
msgid "Save Changes"
msgstr "Button: Save Useless Changes"`,

	`#. Field in products widget class
#: includes/widgets/class-wc-widget-products.php:53
msgid "Widget Title"
msgstr "Field: Useless Widget Title"`
];
const mergedContent = mergePotFileContent(fileContents);
```

#### Merging Pot Objects

```typescript
import { mergePotObject } from 'gettext-merger';

const setOfBlocksArray = [{
	msgid: 'text1',
	comments: {
		extracted: ['#. Translator comment'],
		reference: ['#: app.js'],
	},
},{
	msgid: 'text2',
	comments: {
		extracted: ['#. Translator comment'],
		reference: ['#: app.js'],
	},
}];

const mergedSet = mergePotObject(setOfBlocksArray);
```

#### Extract Pot Header

```typescript
import { extractPotHeader, Block } from 'gettext-merger';

const potFileContent = [`# Copyright (C) 2024 FantasyTech
# This file is distributed under the same license as the Unicorn Plugin.
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: Project Name\n"

msgid "Hello"
msgstr "Hola"

msgid "Goodbye"
msgstr "Adi√≥s"`];
const [header, remainingContent] = extractPotHeader(potFileContent);
```
